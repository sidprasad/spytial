"""
Relationalizer for generic objects with __dict__ or __slots__.

Design Decisions:
- Comprehensive inspection: Use inspect.getmembers to enumerate all attributes, ensuring we capture properties, descriptors, and inherited fields that serialization might include.
- Filtering for relevance: Skip private attributes (starting with "_"), methods, functions, and modules to focus on meaningful data for visualization.
- Serialization alignment: Include attributes even if not obviously serializable, as the relationalizer creates relations and the provider system handles serialization downstream.
- Property/descriptor handling: Evaluate properties and descriptors on the instance to get actual values, preventing issues with dynamic attributes.
- Performance: Limit to small/medium objects (<1 second) by using try-except for safe access and avoiding deep recursion.
- Overlap avoidance: Expand can_handle to include class-based objects but exclude basic types handled by other relationalizers (e.g., lists, dicts).
- Consistency: Maintain binary relations for simplicity, as established for generic objects.
