    "This demo taught you three fundamental concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Spatial Constraints Define Structure**\n",
    "Trees aren't just linked data - they have spatial meaning. Left children go left, right children go right. sPyTial makes this explicit and visual.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Annotations Compose Through Inheritance**  \n",
    "RBTreeNode inherited all spatial behavior from TreeNode, then added color. This is compositional design - you build complex visualizations by combining simple, reusable spatial rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Spatial Type Checking Catches Bugs**\n",
    "When your data violates its spatial constraints (like cycles in trees), sPyTial acts as a structural debugger. This isn't just pretty pictures - it's **spatial verification** of your data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional CS Education**: \"Here's a tree. Imagine it spatially. Debug with print statements.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**sPyTial CS Education**: \"Here's a tree with explicit spatial constraints. See it visually. Debug with spatial feedback.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't just better visualization - it's **spatial programming** where structure and meaning are unified.\n",
