# Spytial


Sometimes you just want to see your program values. 
You don't need an interactive dashboard or a production-grade visualization system. You just need a diagram that lays it out clearly so you can understand what's going on.

That's what Spytial is for. It is diagramming system 
built to make it as easy to get a diagram as it is to call
`print`. 

You always get a diagram **for free* for any value, and then
use Spytial's constraint vocabulary to refine it til it resembles what you might expect.

## Get started 

1. **Install** — `pip install spytial-diagramming` (Python 3.8–3.12, nothing else to set up).
2. **Decorate** — add layout rules to your class with decorators like `@orientation` and `@attribute`.
3. **Draw** — call `spytial.diagram(obj)`. It opens in your browser, or renders inline in a notebook.

That's the whole loop. [Walk through the example above, line by line →](getting-started.md)

## Operations at a glance

Layout is controlled by two kinds of operation. Attach them as class decorators
(`@spytial.orientation(...)`), to individual objects, or via `typing.Annotated`.
Full details and arguments are in [Operations](operations.md).

**Constraints** — shape the geometry

| Operation | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `orientation` | Place a field's target in a direction (`below`, `left`, …) |
| `align` | Line selected nodes up on a shared axis |
| `cyclic` | Arrange selected nodes in a ring |
| `group` | Enclose selected nodes in a labelled region |

</div>

<div markdown="1">

**Directives** — change how things are drawn

| Operation | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `attribute` | Show a field as a label inside the node |
| `atomColor` · `edgeColor` | Color nodes / edges |
| `hideAtom` · `hideField` | Hide nodes / fields |
| `tag` | Add a computed label to matching nodes |
| `inferredEdge` | Draw a derived edge between nodes |
| `size` · `icon` | Resize / icon-ify nodes |

</div>
