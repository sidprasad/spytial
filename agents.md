# Agents

This document outlines the agents or components involved in the `CnD` Python integration project.

## Serializer Agent
### Description
The `CnDSerializer` class is the primary agent responsible for serializing Python-like data structures into a format compatible with the CnD framework. It traverses objects, captures their attributes, and establishes relationships between them.

### Key Features
- Handles primitive types, collections, and custom objects.
- Prevents infinite recursion with cyclic references.
- Supports objects with `__dict__` and `__slots__`.

### Methods
- `serialize(obj)`: Serializes the given object and returns a structured representation.
- `_walk(obj, depth=0, max_depth=100)`: Recursively traverses the object to capture its structure and relationships.

### Limitations
- Does not handle functions, modules, or file handles.
- Limited support for custom serialization methods like `__reduce__` or `__getstate__`.

## Future Agents
### Potential Additions
- **Deserializer Agent**: To reconstruct Python objects from the serialized format.
- **Visualization Agent**: To provide graphical representations of the serialized data.
- **Validation Agent**: To ensure the integrity and consistency of serialized data.

## Contribution
If you wish to contribute to the development of additional agents, please submit a pull request or open an issue in the repository.
